### Hi I am Stefan

I like JavaScript
I talk about some rendering on the web
Note:
* I mostly work on frontends, sometimes also on backends
* JavaScript is my preference because it runs almost anywhere
---

### Site loading
Problem
   1. Visit site
   2. loading
   3. Site rendering (10 minutes later...)
Note:
* Low network connection
* The loading indicator comes early, the interactivity really late
* Site appears when user is already frustrated or gone
---




### What has happened?
Note:
responsibility to render
---

**CSR**: **C**lient-**S**ide **R**endering - rendering an app in a browser, generally using the JavaScript.
Note:
* Website is developed with JavaScript (React)
* Client-side rendering (CSR) means rendering pages directly in the browser using JavaScript. All logic, data fetching, templating and routing are handled on the client rather than the server.

Note:
* Large bundles tend to long loading times
* Heavy code splitting required  
---

### How to solve?
---

**SSR**:
**S**erver-**S**ide **R**endering - rendering a client-side or universal app to HTML on the server.
----

![Server-Rendering](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/images/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web/server-rendering-tti.png)
Note:
* Fast FP and FCP --> leads to fast TTI
* Disadvantage: takes time until site arrives in client (late TTFB)
* React/Next.js | Vue with nuxt |¬†Angular with Universal
----

### Is it only black or white?
----

### No, let's mix!
---

### Static-/ Prerendering
- **Static- /Prerendering**: running a client-side application at build time to capture its initial state as static HTML.
----

Note:
* Perfect for relative static sites
* Preact has pre-rendering included, Next.js too
* Gatsby.js
* Netflix implemented it for landingpages
---

### Rehydration
- **Rehydration**: ‚Äúbooting up‚Äù JavaScript views on the client such that they reuse the server-rendered HTML‚Äôs DOM tree and data.

**Problem**: generally double the work but still client-side blocked rendering
Note:
* Server takes time to render PLUS waiting for JavaScript interactivity
* Nahcladen
---

### Ok, but how doing that?
---

### Using Next.js

* Framework for React
* Flexibility for rendering possibilites
Note:
* Other possibilities: Vue with Nuxt, Angular with Angular Universal (etc)
* There are a lot of things to consider, Next.js solves them for us
----

### Next.js does a lot for us
## Things to consider
----

* Rendering
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Routing
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Data-fetching
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->  
* Re-hydration
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Code chunking
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
---

### Render per-page
* Chunked bundles per page
* Automatic preloading of other pages
----

### Flexible output
Pages can be built as:
* **œÉ** Server-rendered
* **‚ö°** Static HTML
* **Œª** Functions (if `serverless` target)
----

### Comparing One-to-One
----

### Testing a landingpage of a recent project
----

### Results
Note:
* Always depending on latency, device etc.
---

### When render on the server?
- Slow network<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Slow devices<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Application must work without JS (Progressive Enhancement)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- SEO purposes<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
----

### When not render on the server?
- SEO is good enough already hint: [Mobile Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Small JS bundle<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- No budget for server ressources<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
----

### Anyhow: Stay flexible!
* Static pre-rendering for landingpages
* For non-SEO pages with dynamic content partly render on server and then request additional content from client (e.g. Dashboards)
* For pages with SEO and dynamic data relevance, render on server and hardly cache em'!

## Terminology
----

- **TTFB**: Time to First Byte - seen as the time between clicking a link and the first bit of content coming in.
----
- **FP**: First Paint - the first time any pixel becomes visible to the user.
----
- **FCP**: First Contentful Paint - the time when requested content (article body, etc) becomes visible.
----
- **TTI**: Time To Interactive - the time at which a page becomes interactive (events wired up, etc).
---

## Types of rendering
----








----


- **Streaming serverside rendering**: Send HTML in chunks
-> fast **FP** and **FCP**
-> React uses [renderToNodeStream()](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html#rendertonodestream) and **hydrate()**
