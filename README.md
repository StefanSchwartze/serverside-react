# Rendering on the web

This is a short talk about rendering on the web, adapted from an [article](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/02/rendering-on-the-web) by [Jason Miller](https://developers.google.com/web/resources/contributors/developit) and [Addy Osmani](https://developers.google.com/web/resources/contributors/addyosmani).

To get started, first install all dependencies:
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm install -g reveal-md
```

To run the presentation, type:
```bash
$ reveal-md slides.md
```

To generate a PDF version of the slides, type:
```bash
$ reveal-md slides.md --print slides.pdf
```
or directly append `?print-pdf` to the browsers URL (don't forget to remove slide numbers like #/1 eg.). Then execute the print command in your browser.
